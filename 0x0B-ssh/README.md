0x0B. SSH

Background Context


Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. We’ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a previous project shared in your intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the my servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.

Note: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

Tasks
0. Use a private key
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:

Only use ssh single-character flags
You cannot use -l
You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase

1. Create an SSH key pair
Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Name of the created private key must be school
Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
The created key must be protected by the passphrase betty
Example:

2. Client configuration file
Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, let’s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
Example:

3. Let me in!
Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.

Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
